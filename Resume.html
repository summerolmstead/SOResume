            <li><strong>Loan Approval Logistic Regression</strong>: A loan approval prediction model aims to answer the key question: Should a loan with specific criteria be approved or denied based on the applicant’s characteristics? By creating and fine tuning our model to try to explain why the loan status is approved or not approved based on the characteristic of the applicant, we could aim to answer this complex question. This logisitic regression dwelves into seeing the impact of each included variable to explain why a loan is approved or not approved.
